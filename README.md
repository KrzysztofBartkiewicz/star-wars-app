# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
# Star Wars App

The purpose of this task is to build simple application allowing to browse list of characters from Star Wars universe (with pagination & search features) and additional page for single person. Application should require user to sign in (hardcoded, any signup process is out of this task scope).

## Required features

 - Login page with hardcoded credentials (`login: luke, pass: iamyourfather`) - not logged in user, shouldn't has access to any other page
 - People page (i.e. `/characters`) - page with list of all characters, it should be paginated and give search option (by name)
 - Person page (i.e. `/charaters/:id` - with more granular information about a specific person (should include movies' titles (pulled from API as well) - this section should be visible only on the desktop version)
 - Favourites functionality (stored in localStorage) - somehow represented on both list and single person pages

## Other requirements
 - Application should be responsive
 - Completed project must be delivered as merge request to given repository
 - deployment & accessible via pubilc URL is nice to have, but optional, otherwise please provide documentation how to run application
 - using TypeScript is optional as well (but still nice to have)

## Resources
 - https://swapi.dev/ - please use this API to create app
 - please use one of the most popular frameworks (Angular, Vue, React (preferred))
